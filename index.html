  <p><em>This is my first website that I've made on my own.</em></p>
  <p>My name is Logan Barr, I love computers and always wanted to code. I enjoy creating my own things and that's one of the many reasons why I love coding. It's such a gift to have to be able to code and work with computers and can't wait to see
    what many things are awaiting for me in the future and can't wait to see what I create. Date: 11/28/18</p>
